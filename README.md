So, I just walked out of seeing Novocaine and honestly, I'm still kinda processing whatever chaos just happened. You know that feeling when you wake up from a weird dream and everything's a jumble? That. It’s like, what even just went on there?

Steve Martin as a dentist gets tangled in this sticky web of deceit, drugs, and oh my God, all the teeth! Seriously, there was enough dental fear fuel in that movie to last a lifetime. And Laura Dern as the girlfriend - like, why is she with him? Does she not see he's sinking into this pit of insanity? I mean, come on, lady, wake up and smell the mouthwash!

> I swear, this movie is a marathon run in flip-flops on a gravel road for both nerves and patience. Half the time, I wasn't sure if I should be biting my nails or laughing. It’s a whiplash between thriller vibes and some dark comedy, but not like the Haha! type - more the Wait, what? kinda comedy, leave me bewildered and reaching for some brain aspirin.

Plus, you ever have that moment when a character makes such a trainwreck choice you yell at the screen? Yeah, that was me, every 10 minutes or so. There's something puzzlingly magnetic about it though, like a car crash you can't look away from. Or maybe I was just too tired to even try.

function doNotUseThisFunction() {
    console.log(Teeth everywhere!);
}

Alright, if you really wanna get lost in a film that'll mess with your brain a bit... maybe go and watch the movie. Or hey, download the movie and let it accompany your popcorn bowl. But fair warning, you might end up questioning all your life choices—or at least your dental hygiene.
